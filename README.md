# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). This app is not intended for use in production-grade software; rather, it is an exercise in the basics of Node and Express. This project was created and published by Dex as part of the Lighthouse Labs web dev bootcamp.
